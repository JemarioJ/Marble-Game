C# Marble Game

This is a basic marble rolling game where the objective is to tilt the board in the direction you want the marbles to roll to successfully get them
into their corresponding holes. The game is played by using the file explorer to select a special game file that contains the locations of the marbles
and holes as well as an image layout of the board. Once loaded the user can use the controls to roll the marbles.
